# Creative Waste

As foreign students, plastic and packaging waste is one of the issues we realised when we look around Tainan. We see restaurants and sellers giving us plastic whenever we want it, even though it is unnecessary. We always get plastic cups when we drink, one-use chopsticks when we eat, and a new sheet of paper every time when we make our order. This is a serious problem that we encounter every day.

Taiwanese or Tainanese street are usually really clean. We can’t see there many litters or waste despite the fact of frequent take-aways and lack of trash bins. But sometimes we can come across these streets that are full of waste.

This is for us - foreign, exchange students - really confusing and we assume that if the cleanness of the streets were not taken care of by as many people as we see, most streets would look similar. This should be a warning for all of us.

## When, Where and Why?

- *First Visit* - 
We wanted to observehow plastic and packaging waste is made.
Therefore, on 9 October noon, we went to Shuixian Gong Market, one of the most famous market in Tainan.



- *Second Visit* - 
We then wanted to see how the locals reduce the waste.
Therefore, we picked Fukurou, the first package-free store in the southern part of Taiwan, as the destination. We went there in the evening on 22 October.

## How did we get there?

- By bus (as tourists)
- By bike, scooter and on foot (as locals)


## How did we document the visits?

- Photos and note jotting

## How did we communicate with the locals?

- Chats when purchasing goods at the stores / shops
- Informal interviews with the shopkeepers


<!-- ## How did we combine and compare those two cases

In our first visit, we observed how plastic and packaging waste is made in one of the most famous market in Tainan; while in the second one, we saw how the locals try to reduce the waste. -->


## With whom? 

- Locals and shopkeepers

# First Visit: Shuixian Gong Market

Plastic and packaging waste is expectedly serious in the restaurants and stores in Shuixian Gong Market. Plastic cups and paper boxes are provided to the customers, even when they are dining in. For takeaways, plastic bags are also provided to separate each kind of food.

As Shuixian Gong Market is the food market with the longest history of 300+ years in Tainan, some people already hinted us that mostly elderlies go there to shop. However, it looks like a perfect place to us to explore local problems and discuss with the locals. We tried to investigate the core issues of food wasting and all trash creation in Tainan and gain inspirations of nifty improvements that could be implemented.

# Second Visit: Fukurou

Fukurou is said to be the first package-free store in Tainan. We wanted to investigate the feasibility of adopting a zero waste lifestyle here, and also the limitations of running a package-free business.

We talked to the shopkeeper, Lin Pei-chun when we tried to make a purchase in store. She introduced us the grains she sells as well as how her brother and her run the business.

We spent some time observing the neighbourhood. We found the location of Fukurou interesting, as it is hidden in a quiet district that seemed to attract less customers. Lin said they chose this location in order to only attract customers with the habit of intentionally bringing their own containers to shop, instead of those who only come to site-see or take photos.

# What's next?

The two visits brought us new points of view and inspired us a lot. We are now forming a bigger picture of the plastic and packaging waste issue, including how habits of the locals create the waste and how some of them are trying to resolve it.
And among all these, we are more concerned about the use of plastic and one-use containers. We are considering to work on a plan that rents eco-friendly cups across Tainan.
